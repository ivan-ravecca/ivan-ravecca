# 👋 Hi there! I'm Iván Sánchez Ravecca

Welcome to my GitHub profile repository – a place where you can learn more about me, my career, passions, and professional journey.

🔭 I’m currently working on UKG as an Engineering Manager, resolving root cause defects, creating tools for observability and reliability of legacy systems.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an IT leader with 18+ years of experience **driving high-performing engineering teams**, scaling technical organizations, and delivering solutions aligned with business strategy. I combine deep technical acumen with strong emotional intelligence, enabling me to build empowered teams and high-trust partnerships.

Over the past several years, I’ve served as an Engineering Manager, Head of Engineering, and Technical Director, leading cross-functional teams, managing complex portfolios, optimizing delivery capacity, and elevating quality standards. I work closely with stakeholders to translate business goals into actionable technical roadmaps while ensuring predictable execution.

With 13+ years of hands-on development expertise—including React, Angular, AWS, and modern UI architecture—I excel at system design, performance optimization, code quality improvements, and implementing scalable engineering practices in agile environments. As a Certified Scrum Master, I bring structure, clarity, and prioritization to sprints, backlogs, and incident management.

I also bring extensive experience in talent development and organizational growth. Over six years in Globant’s Gatekeeping program, I led technical interviews, refined hiring processes, and mentored engineers, while driving onboarding programs, boot camps, and training for emerging talent.

**What I solve**: Scaling engineering teams, modernizing front-end architectures, improving delivery efficiency, aligning tech strategy with business outcomes, and building resilient processes that support long-term growth.
